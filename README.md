# ImagePromptGenerator

This project provides a way to generate image prompts based on given scenarios and situations, particularly designed for platforms like Instagram. The main workflow of the program involves two stages: initially generating a scene based on a character and situation and then refining that scene to produce a final result.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository_link_here]
cd [repository_directory_name]
```

2. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. name the .env.example file to .env:
```bash
mv .env.example .env
```

## Usage

1. To use the program, simply run the main.py script:
```bash
python main.py
```

2. You can modify the character and situation variables in main.py to generate prompts for different scenarios.
